# Database_Pipeline
1) Use Python to call the OpenWeatherMap API (an API that stores weather data across the U.S) and store it in JSON. (I am calling 7 APIs for 7. different U.S cities)

2) Use Python to create a connection to an postgresql database.
3) Use Python to upload the data aquired from the api response to the database.
